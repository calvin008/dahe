This is a very suitable practical web project for learning, multi-store take-out small program. The project is divided into three parts. The back-end API is developed by springboot3, based on java17. The front-end consists of two parts: the small program part and the back-end management, both of which are developed based on vue3 syntax. The back-end management uses self-developed lightweight RBAC management, which controls the display and usage permissions of pages, menus, and custom directives by controlling page routing, menu menus, and custom directives.
